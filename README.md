# Robo-mussel
This repository is a collection of C/C++ code for the Arduino hardware and software platform.

The device I've built is a simple One-Wire temperature logger that utilizes two Type-K thermocouples and an Arduino UNO along with an extreme low power datalogging shield equipped with a microSD slot. The datalogging shield was developed by Dead Bug Prototypes from Norway: https://www.tindie.com/products/Dead_Bug_Prototypes/extreme-low-power-data-logging-shield-for-arduino/

This temperature logger is being used to develop a biomimetic mussel bed to be used as an accurate proxy for logging live body temperatures of the marine mussel species M. edulis in the lab and field. More information about the project can be found here: https://rmjudge.com/

Funding for this research is provided by the Creative Endeavor Award from the Northeastern University Office of Undergraduate Research.
